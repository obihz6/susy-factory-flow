# The Power Planner's Math (decoded)

The community "GTNH Power Planner" spreadsheet - title cell reads
"GregTech New Horizons - Power Planner, Version(s) 2.9, Made by Fox" - is the
source of truth for the planner's power sector (see `power-sector.md`). This
file is the workbook reverse-engineered: every sheet's model reconstructed
from its formulas, 2026-08-30, from Jack's copy at
`C:\Users\jack\Downloads\Copy of GTNH Power Planner 2.9.xlsx`.

How it was read: the xlsx was unzipped and each worksheet XML dumped to
"ref: value {=formula}" text. Most row LABELS in the workbook are in-cell
images (it is a Google Sheets export), so meanings below are inferred from
formulas plus GTNH mechanics; formulas are quoted verbatim where they carry
the model. Caveats for the build phase:

- An early dump pass mis-attributed some plain values (not formulas) to
  neighbouring cells; the dumper was fixed (self-closing `<c/>` cells) and
  dumps regenerated, but any VALUE cited here should be re-read from a fresh
  extraction before it becomes shipped data. Formulas are trustworthy.
- Extract data tables PROGRAMMATICALLY from the xlsx (rotor catalog, fuel
  tables, the workbook's own computed sample cells as golden test values).
  No hand transcription.
- Where the sheet simplifies the game, the game wins: cross-check formulas
  against GT5U/GT++ source (`C:\Users\jack\gtnh-sources`) when transcribing.

Sheet inventory: Large Turbines, Large Engines, Singleblocks, Rotor Data,
Fuel Data, then numbered machine sheets 1-13: Large Boiler, SOFC, Fluid
Reactor, DEHP, Solar Tower, THTR, HTGR, LFTR, Fusion Reactor, Compact Fusion
Reactor, LNR, Antimatter, EOH.

Conventions: 20 ticks/s appears as x20 or /20 everywhere; reactor-side fluid
rates are L/s while turbine flows are L/t; "amps" rows are
`EU/t / voltage(tier)` via the shared voltage ladder
(`'Large Turbines'!L56:N68`: LV 32 ... UXV 536,870,912). Costs are negative.

## Shared machinery

### The rotor catalog (`Rotor Data`, rows 6-171: 166 materials)

Per material: `C` tier, `D` unlock ("00-Steam" ... "13-UXV"), `F` base
durability, `G` overflow tier (1-3), `H/I/J` steam/gas/plasma material
multipliers (almost always 1). Then 4-wide `[Small, Normal, Large, Huge]`
column groups, Tight and Loose variants each, for the three turbine classes:

- Steam: efficiency `Z:AC` / `AT:AW` (loose), optimal flow L/t `AE:AH` /
  `AY:BB`.
- Gas: efficiency `BN:BQ` / `CH:CK`, optimal ENERGY flow EU/t `BS:BV` /
  `CM:CP` (divide by fuel EU/L for L/t).
- Plasma: efficiency `DB:DE` / `DV:DY`, optimal energy flow `DG:DJ` /
  `EA:ED`, plus `DL:DO` = EU/t at optimal (used by the XL plasma derate).

Size table (rows 174-177): durability x1/x2/x3/x4 for Small/Normal/Large/
Huge, efficiency delta -50/-25/0/+25 (already baked into the size columns).
`totalDurability = F x sizeMult`.

### The turbine formula (one formula, per-class constants)

```
EUout = MAX(1, ROUNDDOWN(eff * fuelEU * flow *
          (1 - |flow - optFlow| / (optFlow * penaltyDiv))))
flow  = MIN(suppliedFlow, maxFlow)
```

Under-feeding is always the plain linear loss (penaltyDiv 1); over-feeding is
softened per class. OT = the rotor's overflow tier:

| Class | maxFlow | over-optimal penaltyDiv |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Large Steam | opt x (0.5 OT + 1) | OT + 1 |
| Large SH Steam | opt x (0.5 OT + 1.5) | OT + 2 |
| Large SC Steam | opt x 1.25 | 1 (none) |
| Large Gas | opt x (1.5 OT) | 3 OT - 1 |
| Large Plasma | opt x (1.5 OT + 1) | 3 OT + 1 |
| every XL variant | opt x 1.25 | 1 (none) |

XL turbines are the same lookups x16. Plasma flows are per second (the sheet
carries x20 conversions). XL Turbo Plasma derates weak plasmas:
`effXL = eff * MIN(1, (fuelEU * 0.005)^2 / RD.DL:DO[size])`.

Rotor lifespan (seconds): regular steam/SH/gas
`2 * ROUNDUP(totalDur / MIN(EU/5, EU^0.6) * 50)`; plasma the same without
the leading 2x; XL variants
`ROUNDUP(totalDur / MIN(EU/25, (EU/5)^0.6) * 50)` x1.25 loose. Loose fitting
multiplies lifespan x1.25 generally; SC steam is the quirk: x0.5 tight, x2
loose.

Steam EU/L (`'Fuel Data'!B6:C11`): Steam 0.5, SH Steam 1.0, SC Steam 1.0,
Dense Steam 500, Dense SH 1000, Dense SC 1000 (dense = 1000x, XL turbines
only; the SC turbine's optimal flow is the rotor figure x16).

### The turbine cascade

SC turbine exhausts SH steam 1:1; SH turbine exhausts Steam 1:1; plain steam
turbine ends the chain. Every reactor sheet ends in up to three banks wired
this way. In the planner this is just three wired cards - the exhaust is a
real output.

### The heat exchanger table (`'Fuel Data'!CF6:DE9`)

Rows: Thermal Boiler, Large Heat Exchanger, (unused fourth), Extreme Heat
Exchanger. Column groups per hot fluid (Lava, Pahoehoe, Hot Coolant, Hot
Solar Salt), fields `Threshold, Max, Throttle, Under Ratio, Over Ratio`:

| Fluid | HX | Threshold L/s | Max | Throttle | Under -> grade | Over -> grade |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Hot Coolant | LHE | 800 | 1600 | -30 | 400 -> Steam | 200 -> SH |
| Hot Coolant | EHE | 8000 | 128000 | -150 | 200 -> SH | 200 -> SC |
| Hot Solar Salt | LHE | 160 | 320 | -6 | 2000 -> Steam | 1000 -> SH |
| Hot Solar Salt | EHE | 1600 | 3200 | -150 | 1000 -> SH | 1000 -> SC |

Chain: effective threshold = base + (tier-1) x Throttle; LHE caps at 2x its
effective threshold, TB/EHE at Max; steam L/t = MIN(input L/s, cap) x Ratio
/ 20; efficiency = 1 - 0.015 x (tier-1) (Thermal Boiler exempt); grade flips
from Under to Over at the threshold (EHE: SH below, SC above - the
supercritical gate). Cold fluid returns 1:1 (closed loop).

## Singleblock generators (`Singleblocks`)

Nine panels (steam turbine, gas turbine, combustion, semifluid, thermal,
plasma, naquadah reactor, two magic absorber/converter variants). Model:

```
burn L/s = (V + ampLoss) / (fuelValue_EU_per_L * efficiency) * 20
EUout    = V EU/t (1 amp of the machine's tier)
```

`V`/`ampLoss` from the ladder (loss 1/2/4/8... EU per packet - the sheet DOES
charge GT's output loss). Efficiency is a per-family, per-tier table
(`AE6:BC17`), e.g. steam turbine 0.85/0.75/0.66/0.60/0.50 LV->IV, gas
turbine 0.95/0.90/0.85..., naquadah reactors RISING with tier
(0.5/0.6/1.0/1.5/2.0/2.5). Solid/one-shot fuels (naquadah rods, magic items)
use EU-per-item lists and a x3600 hour basis instead of L/s.

## Large Engines (`Large Engines`)

- Large Combustion Engine: 2048 EU/t, boosted x3 = 6144. Boost consumes
  40 L/s oxygen and raises fuel EFFICIENCY x1.5 (3x power for 2x fuel).
  Lubricant 1000 L/hr. Fuels over 2048 EU/L refuse to run unboosted
  (`IF(AND(fuelEU>2048, NOT(boost)), 0, ...)`).
- Extreme Combustion Engine: 10900 EU/t, boosted 32700; liquid oxygen 40;
  lubricant 8000 L/hr; own 3-fuel list (HOG family).
- A third 2048/6144 block over the semifluid fuel list.
- GT++ Rocket Engines: throttle setting; output
  `1.6384 * P * cbrtCap30k * cbrtCap80k` where `P = 0.05 * throttle *
  fuelEU`, with cube-root falloff past 30k and 80k EU; CO2 out 1000/hr, air
  intake `0.01 * EU`, liquid hydrogen `0.003 * EU` when boosted (x3 caps).
  A second variant uses efficiency `1.5 * EXP(-fuelCoeff / 0.2)` (per-fuel
  coefficient column in Fuel Data).
- One more tiered block (T1-T3, capacity 375000/1e6/2.5e6, decay 200/400/
  700, `SQRT(MIN(16, x)) * 1.2^tier` and a `(...)^12.5` durability law) -
  NOT yet identified; resolve against GT++ source at build time.

## Large Boilers (`1. Large Boiler`)

Four blocks: Bronze 1200 L/t steam, Steel 3000, Titanium 4000 SH,
Tungstensteel 16000 SH (per boiler). Rules:

- Dual-fuel: burning a liquid AND a solid at once = 100% output; either
  alone = 80% (960/2400/3200/12800), and dual-fuel halves each fuel's burn
  rate (the x2 on the divisor).
- Consumption: liquid L/s = 1000 / divisor, solid items/s = 1 / divisor;
  per-tier fuel tables in Fuel Data (higher tiers burn faster - smaller
  divisors). Water in = steam / 160.
- Titanium/Tungstensteel chain SH turbines into steam turbines (cascade).

## SOFC I / II (`2. SOFC`)

Fuel burners with a steam byproduct worth roughly as much as the direct EU:

- Mk I: 2048 EU/t, eff 1.0, fuel L/s = ROUNDDOWN(20 x 2048 / fuelEU),
  oxygen 100 L/s, byproduct 20,000 L/s plain Steam.
- Mk II: 24576 EU/t, eff = MAX(1, fuelEU/1000) (only fuels > 1000 EU/L
  benefit), oxygen 2000 L/s, byproduct 96,000 L/s SH Steam.

## IC2 Fluid Reactor (`3. Fluid Reactor`)

Reactor interiors are NOT modeled - four preset designs mapping to hot
coolant L/s per reactor (1150 / 1380 / 1340 / custom). Rod consumption is
absent from the sheet entirely. Hot coolant -> LHE or EHE -> cascade.
Banner: "Try Vacuum Reactors Instead".

## DEHP (`4. DEHP`)

Parasitic -480 EU/t per pump; two modes: Direct Steam 25,600 L/t SH-grade
steam per pump (water in = steam/160), or Coolant Heating 192 L/t hot
coolant. Geothermal: nothing burned.

## Solar Tower (`5. Solar Tower`)

Rings 1-5 -> heliostats `(28 + 8r) x r` (340 at 5 rings) -> hot solar salt
out at exactly 1/10 the circulated cold salt (preset table: 38.6 / 104.6 /
217.4 / 431 / 883 L/s). Salt loop closed through the HX (solar salt ratios
1000-2000 L steam per L salt). NO day/night factor anywhere in the sheet -
it prices the daytime rate as constant. Power from nothing.

## THTR (`6. THTR`)

Pebble fill F (up to 675,000): efficiency
`MIN(1, 0.01 + ((F - 100000)/57500)^2 / 100)` (parabola - partial fills are
brutal), pebble cost `0.005 x F x eff`, parasitic `-3840 / eff` EU/t, hot
coolant `4800 x eff` L/t -> EHE -> SC cascade.

## HTGR (`7. HTGR`)

Fill x (of 10,000), 9 fuel pebble types each defined by `Base/Mult/Exp`
triples: output multiplier `(Base x) * (1 + (Mult-1)x)^(1 + (Exp-1)x)`,
efficiency `MIN(1, 0.1 + 0.9(1 - (1-x)^3))`, pebble cost
`fill x (PI() - 3) x 0.01 x eff` (yes, pi minus 3). TWO output streams: hot
coolant `0.5 x fill x mult` L/s AND direct plain steam `0.1 x fill x mult`
(x160 L/t). Parasitic -1536 EU/t.

## LFTR (`8. LFTR`)

Direct EU, no turbines: 16 amps of the fuel's base tier (Fuel 1 EV 32,768;
Fuel 2 IV 131,072; Fuel 3 LuV 524,288 EU/t) burning 1 L/s of fuel. Sparged
byproducts per second: U-Salt, T-Salt, TB-Salt, UF6, and 0.33 L/s
Uranium-233 always. The LFTB breeder makes the fuel: base 1920-7680 EU/t
over 1800-3000 s per 1000 L, overclockable at x4 power / x2 speed per tier
(deliberately lossy).

## Fusion + Compact Fusion (`9.` / `10.`)

Fuel Data holds the 66-recipe fusion table: product plasma, min mark, EU/L,
startup EU, two inputs with L-per-L ratios, EHE max L/s, decay gas. Output
L/s and reactor drain EU/t per mark are precomputed columns (Helium: 156 L/s
and -1920 EU/t at Mk-I; Compact: 10,000 L/s and -122,880 at MK-I - same
shape, ~64x). Three conversion routes are modeled, all reusing shared
machinery: Large Plasma Generator, XL Turbo Plasma Turbine, and plasma ->
EHE -> dense/SC steam -> turbine banks. The sheet's own numbers show the EHE
route beating direct turbining ~1.5-1.8x. Decay gas returns 1:1 for loop
closure (D-T -> Helium).

## LNR (`11. LNR`)

```
EU/t = baseEUt(fuel) x coolantEff x boosterMult x count
```

Fuels MK1-MK6 (975,000 EU/t up to 2.08e9); coolants None/IC2 1.05/Super
1.5/Cryotheum 2.75/Tachyon 5.0 (1000 L/s, Tachyon 20); boosters x2/x3/x4/
x16/x64 multiply output AND fuel burn (180 or 20 L/s of booster fluid);
liquid air flat 2400 L/s. The sheet also models the whole excited-fuel
PRODUCTION chain (9 recipe dusts x T1-T4 machines with EU costs) and nets it
against the reactor - its own sample config is net NEGATIVE, which is the
cautionary tale the planner will surface naturally once the chain is wired.

## EOH (`12. EOH`)

Modeled as a materials machine with an EU bill (net-negative power at low
tiers): 43 star blocks with per-star duration/success/EU-in/EU-out tables, a
success-pity expectation model, x4 EU per overclock, hydrogen/helium
overflow multipliers, star matter yields. Port the success/pity expectation
(`success = clamp(base - 0.0925(t2-1) + 0.05(t3-1))`, expected tries from
the pity ladder) rather than the raw columns.

## Antimatter (`13. Antimatter`)

The one superlinear source. Per 20 s cycle with AM = antimatter quantity and
catalyst-fluid exponent constants K:

```
gain  =  AM^(0.5 + K_spacetime) x (0.2 + K_depleted)
cost  = -(1e7 + (AM x 1000)^(1.5 - K_tengam)) - (AM x 10^4)^(1.5 - K_shirabon)/20
```

plus a burn stage capped at int64 EU per burn. Gain exponent ~0.5+, cost
exponent ~1.5-: the optimum is interior, and the sheet finds it with a
3235-row sweep. Reimplement as a small numeric search, not a table. Catalyst
fluids (Tengam, Spacetime, Shirabon, Depleted Mk-V) are consumed at
`AM^0.5 / AM^(2/7) / AM^(1/3)` rates; depleted fuel byproduct feeds LNRs.
