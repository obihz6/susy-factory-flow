/**
 * What a drawer IS. Four jobs that happen to share one card, and they mean
 * such different things that the board draws each as a different shape.
 *
 * Three are read off the WIRING and cannot be chosen:
 *
 * - `source`  nothing feeds it, so it invents its resource. The plan's
 *             declared import, and one of the two cards still allowed to
 *             break conservation.
 * - `buffer`  fed and drawn from, so it is neither end of anything. The only
 *             one of the four that lives INSIDE the system: it passes on what
 *             its takers pull and not one item more, so a producer cannot use
 *             it as a quiet dump.
 * - `idle`    unwired. Barely exists in practice - `pruneOrphanStorages`
 *             sweeps a drawer the moment its last wire goes - but a drawer
 *             mid-drag has to be called something.
 *
 * The fourth is a CHOICE, and it only exists once nothing draws from the
 * drawer (see StorageDrainMode):
 *
 * - `product`    pulls its feeder flat out. The thing the factory is for.
 * - `byproduct`  asks for nothing and catches what is left over.
 * - `trash`      asks for nothing and VOIDS what arrives. The drawer as a
 *                bin: it un-clogs its feeder exactly like the old trash can
 *                node, and what it eats never appears in the books.
 *
 * Product vs byproduct is the difference between "make as much of this as
 * you can" and "the extra has to go somewhere"; trash is "the extra stops
 * existing", which is what every overflow-into-a-void setup really is.
