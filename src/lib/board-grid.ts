/**
 * The board grid.
 *
 * One number governs the whole canvas: the background pattern, the snap step,
 * every card's width and height, and the vertical pitch of the port rows. If a
 * card is a whole number of cells tall and sits on a cell corner, then every
 * one of its ports lands on a grid line too — which is the point. Wires can
 * then run along the same lines the cards are built from.
 *
 * The rules, in order of importance:
 *
 *  1. Node positions are multiples of `BOARD_GRID`.
 *  2. Node widths and heights are multiples of `BOARD_GRID`.
 *  3. A port row is `PORT_ROW_HEIGHT` tall (two cells), and the block above
 *     the rails is a whole number of `HEAD_ROW_HEIGHT` (also two cells), so
 *     port centres land on a grid line: head + 20 + 40i.
 *
 * Rule 3 is why the head, the footer and the config panels have fixed heights
 * rather than sizing to their content. Content that used to set the height now
 * sits inside a box whose height the grid sets.

 * reads at. THREE cells came back off the card on 2026-09-09 without ever
 * touching it - 22 to 21 to 20 to 19 - and every one of them came out of the
 * two item chips and the output coupling instead: 140 to 112 a chip, 34 to
 * 30 the coupling. The picture has been 96px throughout, which is the
 * measurement to re-check first if this number moves again.
 *
 * What pays for it is the NAME, which wraps to two lines rather than
 * truncating. The chip's name column is down to 70px, so a name past about
 * 22 characters now clips on the second line; the hover carries the whole
 * one. That is the trade, and it is the reason not to take a fourth cell.
