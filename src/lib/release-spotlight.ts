/**
 * The release NOTICE: the one thing that is allowed to arrive uninvited.
 *
 * It is the ONLY thing that tells a player a release happened. The changelog
 * dialog, the version chip's unread dot and the Welcome tab's "new in vX"
 * section were all removed (Jack, 2026-09-08), so this is the announcement:
 * a line per change, an icon and a TITLE each, no sentences, read in about
 * four seconds and closed.
 *
 * ONE PER RELEASE, AND ONLY WHEN THE RELEASE EARNS IT. A version with no entry
 * in `RELEASE_SPOTLIGHTS` shows nothing at all - a bug-fix release should not
 * stop anybody's work. That choice is made per release, on purpose: the notice
 * is a favour the reader grants us and it stops being one the third time it
 * arrives to announce nothing.
 *
 * RULES FOR WRITING ONE:
 * - Titles, not sentences, and written the way a spec sheet is written:
 *   "Multiple recipes per machine", not "One machine, several recipes", and
 *   never "You can now run several recipes on one machine." Flat, technical,
 *   no voice. Jack, 2026-09-08: they should read scientific.
 * - Four words is long. "Faster performance" is a whole line.
 * - Eight lines is the ceiling, and the ceiling is not a target.
 * - Say what changed on THEIR board, never how it was built. No "solver", no
 *   "refactor", no version-control words. Same doctrine as changelog.ts.
 * - No em dashes.
