/**
 * The plan is a CLOSED system.
 *
 * Nothing appears from nowhere and nothing vanishes. The only places that
 * rule is suspended are the ones a player declares by hand: a SOURCE drawer
 * (nothing feeds it), a DRAIN drawer (nothing draws from it), and the trash
 * can, which is a drain you can watch destroying things. A BUFFER is neither
 * and passes on exactly what its takers pull.
 *
 * So every fixture here wires its own boundary, deliberately and visibly -
 * these are the tests that are ABOUT the boundary, so they must never go
 * through `closeBoundaries`.
 *
 * Every recipe runs exactly one operation per second: 20 ticks at 20 ticks/s,
 * one machine, no parallel, and LV on an LV recipe is not an overclock. So an
 * output of `n` is a rate of `n` per second and the percentages below can be
 * read straight off the amounts.
