/**
 * The board's steady state as equations, solved directly: the BOOKS half of
 * the solver, per docs/solver-equations.md. Conservation is a row, the clog
 * is an equals sign (an output wired only to machines may not make more than
 * its wires carry), and the answer is picked by a lexicographic chain of
 * solves - so there are no rounds, no transients and nothing to latch. The
 * iterative engine in equilibrium.ts keeps the DIAGNOSIS: capability, the
 * "one wire fixes it" stories, the clog names.
 *
 * Stages, each optimum locked before the next runs (Jack's ruling,
 * 2026-08-19: solve for the maximum - a fed machine with somewhere to put
 * its output runs, exactly as in game):
 *   1. Everything runs: maximize total act. A byproduct drawer is permission
 *      to run, a plain buffer voids its overflow like a real drawer, and
 *      nothing idles that conservation would let move.
 *   2. Fairness: progressive max-min over acts within the locked total - the
 *      LP form of the game's round-robin split, so contended supply shares
 *      evenly-with-saturation instead of handing one consumer everything.
 *   3. Recycle before importing: minimize source-drawer outflow.
 *   4. Ship before banking: minimize pool fill, so a buffer passes stock on
 *      to whatever downstream will take and holds only what nothing wants.
 *   5. Canonicalize: minimize total flow, one deterministic point.
 *
 * There is deliberately NO "purpose" stage preferring product drawers: it
 * starved real machines to fatten an export drawer, and the game has no such
 * preference - pipes round-robin. Targets are display arithmetic, not rows.
 *
 * Validated against the tick simulator (src/lib/solver-lab/simulate.ts -
 * exact agreement on real player boards at the doctrine prime) and the full
 * community corpus.
