/**
 * Equilibrium solver for the wired factory graph.
 *
 * The old iteration seeded every node from a demand-only guess and let asks
 * chase each other around the graph. That system has many self-consistent
 * answers: "F asks for no apples because it has no bananas, B makes no
 * bananas because F is not asking" is as stable as the fully running plan,
 * and real boards kept landing on the starved one (community gridlock
 * report, 2026-08-02: 26.67/s of toluene in the tank, consumers granted
 * 1.8/s of it, everything downstream at 0.5%).
 *
 * This solver removes the low answers instead of damping toward them, the
 * same way Helmod's matrix solver (MIT, github.com/Helfima/helmod) treats a
 * production block: solve the coupled system simultaneously rather than
 * propagate asks sequentially. Our unknowns differ - machine counts are
 * fixed here, so we solve for per-node utilizations - which turns the
 * problem into a monotone fixed point:
 *
 * - every node starts at FULL BLAST (capability 1, demand 1); the board is
 *   born jump-started, so a feedback loop that can sustain itself never
 *   needs a phantom source to prove it;
 * - each Jacobi round recomputes offers, honest asks, and allocations from
 *   the previous round's vectors only (no mid-pass reads, so wiring order
 *   cannot change the answer), and utilizations descend until the real
 *   constraints - machine counts, genuinely scarce inputs - stop them;
 * - lossy loops decay geometrically, so a per-component geometric
 *   extrapolation jumps them straight to their limit instead of grinding
 *   thousands of passes.
 *
 * Scarce supply is split by water-filling (progressive filling): every
 * hungry line gets an equal share, lines that need less than their share
 * are capped at their ask, and the slack is re-offered to the still-hungry.
 * A 2000/s fleet next to a 400/s fleet on a 26/s tank therefore cannot
 * crush the small asker out of the trickle it needs.
 *
 * CONSERVATION. The plan is a CLOSED system. Nothing appears from nowhere and
 * nothing vanishes, and the only places that rule is suspended are the two a
 * player declares by hand:
 *
 *   a SOURCE drawer  nothing feeds it, so it invents its resource
 *   a DRAIN drawer   nothing draws from it, so it swallows what arrives
 *
 * plus the trash can, which is a drain you can see destroying things. A
 * BUFFER is neither: it passes on exactly what its consumers pull.
 *
 * So a machine is bounded at BOTH ends. `capableByNode` asks whether every
 * ingredient has somewhere to come from, `disposalByNode` whether everything
 * it makes has somewhere to go, and it runs at the lesser. A port with no
 * wire on it is not an escape hatch in either direction: an input with no
 * feeder is an empty bus and an output with no taker is a full one, and both
 * stop the machine dead. A node standing on the disposal limit is CLOGGED.
 *
 * A clog has to be JUSTIFIED by what takers would take if nothing were
 * clogged. Judged on live flows alone, a clog can hold itself in place: the
 * held machine asks for less, its suppliers read "not wanted", their clogs
 * deepen, and a one-round allocation wobble becomes a stable answer a fixed
 * fraction below the truth (the platline board stranded at exactly 90%).
 * Disposal is therefore judged against a SHADOW of the demand system - same
 * asks, same fairness, but throttled by pressure-only demand (`demWant`) and
 * offered capability instead of throttled rates - a world with no clogs in
 * it, where a suppressed want cannot masquerade as a missing one.
 *
 * This is a real cost and it is the point. Every plan now has to say where
 * its raw materials come from and where its product goes, in drawers, on the
 * board - and until it does, it reads zero rather than quietly inventing the
 * answer at both ends.
 *
 * BALANCED RINGS get one appeal. A ring that conserves its circulating goods
 * exactly (the cell loops: every cell out of the electrolyzer comes back
 * through a canner) has a continuum of self-consistent levels and no
 * restoring force between them, so the descent's transients ratchet it to
 * zero even though the same ring, primed once in game, runs forever. A ring
 * whose machines all converge to zero capability is therefore re-solved with
 * its internal needs allowed to borrow against the ring's own capability
 * (the solver priming the loop), and that answer is adopted only if the
 * borrowing idles out - see the balanced-ring rescue below.
 *
 * THE SETTLEMENT closes the books last. Because capability is clog-blind on
 * purpose, a consumer downstream of a clogged supplier converges wanting and
 * "capable of" full blast while its wire carries a trickle - and every
 * figure multiplied off that level mints material from nowhere. After the
 * verdicts converge (and any rescue is judged), a separate fixed point
 * bounds each node's ACTUAL level by what its wires really delivered and
 * re-settles the actual flows at it, without ever feeding back into
 * capability, demand or disposal: the card still diagnoses the clog, the
 * books stop paying out on it.

  // in-game cell loop: an electrolyzer eats 1 acid cell + 6 empty and hands
  // all 7 cells back through its canners) has a continuum of self-consistent
  // levels and no restoring force between them. The descent's transients -
  // fair-share splits taken while a sibling ceiling is still settling, a
  // drawer's one-round offer lag - each shave a little off the circulating
  // level, and with nothing to put a dip back (a SURPLUS ring re-inflates by
  // itself, which is why gain > 1 rings hold) the level ratchets down the
  // continuum to zero. In game the same ring, primed once, runs forever.
  //
  // So a ring whose machines all converged to zero CAPABILITY gets one
  // appeal: solve again with the ring's internal needs allowed to draw their
  // residual ask from an anchor - thin air, landing on the ring's own wires,
  // strictly after every real supplier, with potentials untouched so real
  // constraints (a short water line, machine counts) still pace the level.
  // The anchor is the solver's own version of the player priming the loop.
  // The verdict is read off the settled anchors themselves: a ring that
  // sustains itself leaves them idling at ~0/s (the workaround that exposed
  // this bug - a source drawer wired into the cell buffer - settles at 0/s
  // the same way), while a genuinely lossy ring leans on them every round,
  // and that rescue is thrown away in favour of the honest dead answer.

  // Capability is deliberately clog-blind (see the two offers in runRound),
  // so a consumer downstream of a clogged supplier converges wanting full
  // blast, reads capable of it, and eats material that never arrives - the
  // silicone board's chem reactor sat at "100%", minting 43.2 L/s of product
  // from a 0.03/s trickle of PDMS. The verdict layer is RIGHT to keep the
  // clog-blind reading - it is what says "one wire clears it" instead of
  // cascading one clog into a board of phantom shortages - but the settled
  // flows must conserve.
  //
  // So one last, separate fixed point, AFTER the verdicts are done: each
  // node's actual level is bounded by what its wires really delivered, and
  // the actual-flow side (desire asks, actual offers, sink absorption) is
  // re-run at that level - a starved machine releases its other ingredients'
  // unclaimed shares, its own output offer shrinks, and the bound chases
  // down its consumers hop by hop. None of it feeds back into cap/dem/disp,
  // so the diagnosis keeps naming the clog while the books keep the truth.
  // Boards whose deliveries already cover every claim - almost all of them -
  // skip this entirely and keep their figures bit for bit.
