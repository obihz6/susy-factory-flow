 * What the plan IMPORTS and what it SHIPS OUT, read off the boundary drawers.

 * drawer was magic and unwired surplus quietly evaporated - two machines
 * making and eating the same item did balance out whether or not a line ran
 * between them. In a closed plan it is no longer true. An unwired output
 * stops its machine and an unwired input starves one, so material only moves
 * where a wire says it does, and the boundary is a set of drawers a player
 * placed on purpose.
 *
 * The difference shows the moment one resource sits on both ends. Import 10
 * carbon at a source drawer, catch 4 spare carbon at a byproduct drawer, and
 * netting reported a single need for 6 - quietly asserting that the spare
 * feeds the need, across a gap with no wire in it. Now it reports both: bring
 * 10 in, take 4 away. Wiring them together is a thing the player can do, and
 * then the books say so because the flows actually changed.
 *
 * Products and byproducts are counted apart for the same reason. One resource
 * can have a product drawer AND a byproduct drawer - some of it is what the
 * factory is for and the rest is what it could not help making - so each gets
 * its own figure instead of a winner-takes-all label.
