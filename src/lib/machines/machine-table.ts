/**
 * Curated machine behaviour: what each multiblock does to a recipe.
 *
 * A recipe export tells us the ingredients, the duration and the EU/t. It does
 * not tell us that titanium pipe casings give a chem plant six parallels, that
 * TPV coils run it at 200%, or that a large chemical reactor overclocks
 * perfectly. That behaviour lives in each multiblock's Java code, so it has to
 * be written down somewhere.
 *
 * We used to scrape it out of multiblock tooltips in the dataset pipeline.
 * Tooltips are prose, and the scraper produced values that were shaped right
 * and meant the wrong thing - most visibly a heat capacity stamped onto coils
 * for machines with no heat mechanic, which handed the chem plant, pyrolyse
 * oven, oil cracker and coke oven overclocks they never get in game.
 *
 * These numbers were first transcribed from ShadowTheAge's GTNH calculator
 * (https://github.com/ShadowTheAge/gtnh, MIT), then audited entry by entry
 * against the actual GT5-Unofficial source (cloned at
 * C:\Users\jack\gtnh-sources\GT5-Unofficial). Where the two disagree - GTNH
 * has rewritten several machines since the reference was written - the mod
 * source wins, the entry says so in a comment, and
 * `machine-table.test.ts` lists it under DIVERGES_FROM_REFERENCE. Two
 * indexing differences are worth knowing when comparing against the
 * reference:
 *
 *   - Their voltage tiers start at LV = 0; ours start at ULV = 0. Their
 *     `recipe.voltageTier + 1` is therefore our `ctx.voltageTier`.
 *   - Their `speed` is a throughput multiplier (2 = twice as fast). We divide
 *     duration by it, so a machine's duration multiplier is `1 / speed`.
 *
 * Machines absent from this table keep using the values the dataset carries,
 * so partial coverage is safe. Add entries as they are verified; do not guess.
 *
 * `machine-table.test.ts` checks every entry against
 * `__fixtures__/reference-coefficients.json`, which is the reference's own
 * definitions evaluated over a grid of tiers and choices. Regenerate it by
 * running the probe described in that test if the reference is ever updated.
