 * A MINIMIZED BOARD: a summary you can look at, not a machine you can wire.

 * It says what is inside (machines, cards, power) and what crosses its
 * border, and that is all it says. There are no ports on it: a wire from the
 * outside cannot be dropped on it, a drag cannot start from it, and nothing
 * on it claims to be starved or clogged. To change anything about the
 * factory in here you open the window - double-click, or the restore button.
 *
 * That is a deliberate retreat. The card used to wear input and output
 * ports built from a solve of the members with the outside world unhooked,
 * which meant a board holding its own source was told it was starving and a
 * board exporting a byproduct was told it was clogged. The numbers here now
 * come from the plan-wide solve, so they are the same numbers the board
 * itself would show with the window open.
 *
 * The wires crossing the border still land on the card - they have to go
 * somewhere - but they dock anywhere on its perimeter, like a drawer's, not
 * on a row that means something.
