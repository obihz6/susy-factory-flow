/**
 * Plays the board's interface sounds by WATCHING the project rather than by
 * instrumenting call sites. Every way a card can land (recipe book add,
 * drawer drag, paste, refactor, undo) funnels through the store, so a diff
 * of ids between one project and the next catches all of them - including
 * paths added later, which is the point.
 *
 * SOUNDS ARE FOR THE CANVAS ONLY (Jack, 2026-08-28): cards landing and
 * leaving, wires connecting and cutting, boards folding and unfolding,
 * card settings changing, bulk changes. Navigation and chrome are silent -
 * no tab sounds, no button sounds. Two guards enforce that beyond the
 * id-diff itself:
 * - A project id change is navigation and plays nothing, and it opens a
 *   short QUIET WINDOW: loading machinery (migrations, icon refreshes,
 *   dataset touch-ups) often rewrites the plan right after a switch, and
 *   none of that is the player's hand.
 * - The config signature ignores cosmetic fields (positions, icons,
 *   colors, tooltips, names), so a refresh that re-resolves art can never
 *   fake a settings change.
 *
 * Undo and redo are deliberately NOT special-cased: undoing a delete diffs
 * as an add and thumps like one, which is what the hand just did.
