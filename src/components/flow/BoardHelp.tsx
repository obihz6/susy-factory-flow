/**
 * The board's help corner: a "?" where the zoom buttons used to live.
 *
 * Hovering it lays a glance sheet over the whole window: each toolbar gets a
 * dashed ring, an arrow, and a card naming what is in it (see
 * `card-parts.tsx`). The things with no toolbar to ring - what a card does,
 * what a drawer does, the keys, the notices - are LEGEND cards: they stack in
 * whatever column has the room, over the panel they are nearest to.
 *
 * Pure glance layer: pointer events stay off everywhere. Moving away folds the
 * whole thing up again.
 *
 * The sheet portals to <body>: the board, the browser and the inspector each
 * sit in their own stacking contexts, so a scrim rendered inside the board
 * could never dim its neighbours.
 *
 * Regions are found by their `data-help-anchor` attribute and measured once
 * per open, so the overlay follows the real layout instead of hardcoding it.
 * Several elements may share one anchor id, and a ring may union several ids
 * (the tool row is three trays and, folded, a trigger).
 *
 * LAYOUT IS COMPUTED, NOT TUNED. Every card is CARD_W wide and cards live in
 * flex COLUMNS whose corner is fixed to a ring, so no card's position depends
 * on another card's height, and an arrow only ever leaves the card whose edge
 * sits on the column's fixed corner. The old hand-set offsets per card broke
 * at every window size the author had not looked at.

 * These used to read 1920x1080, written as though they were real pixels
 * (Jack, 2026-09-07). They are not: `show()` divides by the scale before
 * comparing, so at the shipped 130% they demanded a 2496x1404 window and
