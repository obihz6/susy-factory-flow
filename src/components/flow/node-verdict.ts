/**
 * The node-level verdict that replaces the bare "Usage %": one state derived
 * from the solver's three separate facts (utilization, what the inputs would
 * allow, what downstream asks), plus the cause and the concrete next action.
 *
 * Two independent questions decide it, both measured against this card's own
 * full blast at its current machine count:
 *
 *   are the inputs short?   `capableUtilization` < 1
 *   is anyone going without? a `deficit` on some output
 *
 *                 | nobody waiting | someone waiting
 *   inputs fine   | balanced /     | BOTTLENECK
 *                 | demand-set     | (add machines HERE)
 *   inputs short  | STARVED        | BLOCKED
 *                 | (nothing to do)| (the fix is upstream)
 *
 * Two more states sit ABOVE that table, because in a closed plan a machine is
 * bounded at both ends and neither of the two words above should ever be made
 * to mean "you have not finished wiring it".
 *
 * UNWIRED is first and beats everything: some slot, input or output, has no
 * wire on it. Nothing declares where that ingredient comes from or where that
 * product goes, so the machine is at zero, and there is no arithmetic to
 * explain - the card just marks every bare slot and you go and connect them.
 * A SOURCE or DRAIN drawer counts as connecting one, which is how a plan says
 * "this part I bring in myself" out loud.
 *
 * CLOGGED is next, and only ever applies to a FULLY WIRED card: everything is
 * connected, and a wired output still cannot shift what it makes, because its
 * takers want less than the machine produces and no drain or can is there to
 * take the rest. The machine runs only as fast as that output empties. It is
 * not a fault - a plan that makes 10 redstone and only wants 5 is a normal
 * plan - so it is stated, not scolded: the card says where the surplus is and
 * offers the honest ways out.
 *
 * The doctrine that follows: running below 100% is not a fault. A machine
 * that hands every asker what it asked for is FINE, whatever its percent
 * reads. Only an unmet ask is a problem, and only when the inputs are already
 * covered is this card the place to fix it. Follow BLOCKED cards upstream and
 * you always arrive at a bottleneck, a dialled source, or a DEAD LOOP — so
 * the red cards are the whole to-do list.
 *
 * That walk only terminates because `dead-loop` exists. In a ring, A blames
 * B, B blames C and C blames A, so without a state that names the ring the
 * advice chases itself forever. See death-spiral.ts.
